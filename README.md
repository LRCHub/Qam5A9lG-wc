# Chappell Roan – The Subway

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I saw your green hair
Beauty mark next to your mouth
There on the subway
I nearly had a breakdown
A few weeks later
Somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me
I had to leave the room
It's just another day
And it's not over
(Ah, ah-ah)
'til it's over,
it's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over
(Ah, ah-ah)
'til it's over
It's never over
'Til I don't look for you on
the staircase
Or wish you thought that we
were still soulmates
But I'm still counting down
all of the days
'Til you're just another girl
on the subway
Made you the villain
Evil for just moving on
I see your shadow
I see it even with the
lights off
I made a promise,
if in four months this
feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city,
I'm movin' to Saskatchewan
It's just another day
And it's not over
(Ah, ah-ah)
'til it's over
Oh, 'til it's over
It's just another day
And it's not over
(Ah, ah-ah)
'til it's over
It's never over
'Til I can break routine
during foreplay
And trust myself that
I won't say your name
But I'm still counting down
all of the days
'Til you're just another girl
on the subway
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away
And she's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away
(She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way,
she's got a way)
She's got a way
(She got, she got away
She got away, she got away)
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away

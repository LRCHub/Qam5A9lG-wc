I could hear all the plans we had when the wind hits me just right
And I'm so sick of wanting all the things I'm haunted by
My sympathy goes to the oldest joke that's survived another year
I wonder where I'm going from where I'm at I wonder why I'm still here

The writing on the subway walls
Reminds me why your words don't console me any more
While I'm lying wide awake on my bedroom floor

I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime

The local paper's always opened up to obituaries and engagements
'Cause I keep track of all the fresh starts and he dying famous
And there's a halo of second-hand smoke underneath the summer stars
Along with conversations we had on this subway car

The writing on the subway walls
Reminds me why your words don't console me any more
While I'm lying wide awake on my bedroom floor

I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime

Remember when
When you said,
You said, "Take these words, do what you want with them"

The writing on the subway walls
Reminds me why your words don't console me any more
While I'm lying wide awake on my bedroom floor

I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
This is my last chance to disappear
I'm the lucky one
I'm getting out of here
I think I may freeze on the last days of summertime

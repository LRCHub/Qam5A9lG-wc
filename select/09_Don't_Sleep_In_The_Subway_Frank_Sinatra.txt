(Come on baby, come on baby)

Don't sleep in the subway baby
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway baby
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

(Come on baby, come on baby)
(Come on baby, come on baby)
You try to be smart, then you, you take it all to heart
'Cause it hurts, it hurts when your ego is deflated

You walk out on me when we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for

I've heard it all a million times, lots of time before
Take off your boots, my sweet, and close the door
(Come on baby, come on baby)
(Come on baby, come on baby)

Don't sleep in the subway baby
Don't you stand around in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway baby
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride, hey nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

(Come on baby)
Come on baby
I got candy, I got flowers
I got kisses, I got hot-cake
I got music
Hey baby, come on home.
